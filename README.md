## Hej ðŸ‘‹

I'm a civil engineer and programmer based in Stockholm, Sweden.
I create apps for the web that helps people visilize data, information, buildings and products.
I also create games on the web.

Most of my projets are under strict NDAs, and are closed sources.

However, I share some of my toughts and ideas here.

Feel free to get inspiration and grab parts of my code. Submit a PR if you feel like it.
Most of my projects here on GitHub are just for fun :)
