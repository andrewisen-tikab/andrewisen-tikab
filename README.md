## Hej ðŸ‘‹

I'm a civil engineer and programmer based in Sweden.
I create apps for the web that helps people visilize data, information and buildings.

Most of my projets are under NDA and closed sources.
However, I share some of my ideas here.

Feel free to get inspiration and grab parts of my code. Submit a PR if you feel like it.
Most of my projects here on GitHub are just for fun :)
